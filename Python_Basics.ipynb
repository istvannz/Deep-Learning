        "Numpy is a library used with Python, it adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. In addition Numpy supports a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Numpy is maintained by a large community (www.numpy.org). In the folllowing exercises you will learn several key numpy functions such as **np.exp**, **np.log**, and **np.reshape**. You will need to be confortable using these functions for future assignments.\n",
        "## Sigmoid activation function using math.exp and np.exp\n",
        "In this activity you will build a function that returns the sigmoid of a real number. The sigmoid activation function will be use throughtout this course and you will be more formally introduced to it in the Logistic Regression section. The sigmoid function is a S-curve that can be either a negitive or postive value, as shown in figure 1.\n",
